# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to gain a functional understanding of a python dependency, matplotlib, to graph and visualize various factors of data. In this particular exercise we visualized a company's ridesharing data with the ultimate goal of presenting our finding's and suggesting recommendations to the head of the company.

## Results: 

There were many differences between the data seen between city types. The rural city type saw the lowest total rides, lowest total drivers, lowest total fares, highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. The Urban city type saw the highest total rides, highest total drivers, highest total fares, highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. While the average fares were higher in rural city types, the overall fare was higher in Urban areas due to the total number of rides being much higher.

While the three city types showed varied characteristics in the summary dataframe, the multi-line 'Total Fare by City Type' was able to demonstrate one similarity between all of them. The linearity between all three cities was relatively flat with a few shared spikes in activity. This shows that while the number of rides was very different, they moved in a way that was consistent amongst eachother over time.

## Summary: 

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Three recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparity among the city types:

1. Urban city types will drive more overall revenue. Focus resources on more densely populated cities to gain a higher amount of total fares. 

2. Lower the average fare in the Rural city type. This will make the ride-share option more appealing in less populated areas.

3. Rural activity may be lower due to the small amount of total drivers. Raising the amount of drivers in rural areas may increase activity in this area.
