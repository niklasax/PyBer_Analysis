# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to gain a functional understanding of a python dependency, matplotlib, to graph and visualize various factors of data. In this particular exercise we visualized a company's ridesharing data with the ultimate goal of presenting our finding's and suggesting recommendations to the head of the company.

## Results: 

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There were many differences between the data seen between city types. The rural city type saw the lowest total rides, lowest total drivers, lowest total fares, highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. The Urban city type saw the highest total rides, highest total drivers, highest total fares, highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. While the average fares were higher in rural city types, the overall fare was higher in Urban areas due to the total number of rides being much higher.

While the three city types showed varied characteristics in the summary dataframe, the multi-line 'Total Fare by City Type' was able to demonstrate one similarity between all of them. The linearity between all three cities was relatively flat with a few shared spikes in activity. This shows that while the number of rides was very different, they moved in a way that was consistent amongst eachother over time.
